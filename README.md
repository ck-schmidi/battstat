# `battstat` - text based battery status used from `i3` window manager

My Thinkpad X260 has two batteries, so the normal i3 battery status doesn't work for me. 

Attention: This tool is very specific for my current setup and you need to have the tool `upower` installed.
If you are interested, fork the project, take a look at the source code and customize it for your needs :)
